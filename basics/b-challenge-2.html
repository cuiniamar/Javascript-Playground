                <h1>Basic Challenge 2</h1>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
                <p>John and Mike both play basketball in different teams. In the latest 3 games, John's team scored 89, 120 and 103 points, while Mike's team scored 116, 94 and 123 points.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Calculate the average score for each team</li>
                    <li>Decide which team wins in average (highest average score), and print the winner to the console. Also include the average score in the ouput</li>
                    <li>Then change the scores to show different winners. Don't forget to take into account there might be a draw (the same average score)</li>
                    <li>EXTRA: Mary also plays basketball, and her team scored 97, 134 and 105 points. Like before, log the average winner to the console. HINT: you will need the && operator to take the decision. If you can't solve this one, just watch the solution, it's no problem.</li>
                    <li>Like before, change the scores to generate different winners, keeping in mind there might be draws</li>
                </ol>
