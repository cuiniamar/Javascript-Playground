            <h1>Basic Challenge 3</h1>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
            <p>John and his family went on a holiday and went to a 3 different restaurants. The bill were $124, $48 and $268.</p>
            <p>To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator (as a function). He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less then $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.</p>
            <p>In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Containing all three tips (one for each bill)</li>
                <li>Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>(NOTE: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply if with 20/100 = 0.2)</p>
            <p>View Console for answer.</p>
        </main>
    </div>
    <script>
        function tipCal(bill) {
            var percentage;
            if (bill < 50) {
                percentage = .2;
            } 
            else if (bill >= 50 && bill < 200) {
                percentage = .15;
            }
            else {
                percentage = .1;
            }
            return percentage * bill;
        }

        var bills = [124, 48, 268];
        var tips = [tipCal(bills[0]),
                    tipCal(bills[1]),
                    tipCal(bills[2])];
        var finalVal = [bills[0] + tips[0],
                        bills[1] + tips[1],
                        bills[2] + tips[2]];
